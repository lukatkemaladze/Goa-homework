    <p>I like GOA because there are a lot of hackthons, programming languages like Python, Javascript, CSS, C ,HTML and ect.They always help children. There is 1 big goal:make scroll on tiktok, videogames and ect. the biggest and the most useful modern thing in world :from scrolling to programming.</p>
    <p>If your child is on the computer all day and keep scrolling,then register him in this amazing academy and he or she will really enjoy it, because everyone will be busy by programming.There are also really good things kids will enjoy.So just tell GOA that you want to register your child here and then choose which team will they join,like 1st,2nd,3rd and ect.</p>
